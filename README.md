# LaxStats Admin Panel

The plan is to create functionality so that during a match, the admin can create match statistics. And users to see in real-time.

<ul>
  <li>API: https://github.com/GrabowskyK/LaxStats_API</li>
  <li>Admin panel: https://github.com/GrabowskyK/LaxStats_Admin_panel</li>
  <li>For users: IN PROGRESS... (for now without API https://github.com/GrabowskyK/LaxStats)</li>
</ul>
