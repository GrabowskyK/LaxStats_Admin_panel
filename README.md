# LaxStats Admin Panel

The plan is to create functionality so that during a match, the admin can create match statistics. And users to see in real-time.

API: https://github.com/GrabowskyK/LaxStats_API
Admin panel: https://github.com/GrabowskyK/LaxStats_Admin_panel
For users: IN PROGRESS... (for now without API https://github.com/GrabowskyK/LaxStats)
